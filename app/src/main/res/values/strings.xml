        Ošťurák is the name of iron (or wooden) stick used for roasting
        sausages on a campfire. This term is used in the area around town Pelhřimov (Vysočina region).
        Why am I telling you about it? Because there is no equivalent for
        this word in czech although ošťurák is used very often.
        I want to spread this word to as many people as possible, because I find it
        much better than napichovák used now. And also to spread my home culture.
        You can see images of it below.
