CTU Bus is an open-source app that shows the times of bus and tram departures from some CTU related
stations in the city of Prague. You can view for example transfer times between

- Koleje Strahov - Dejvická
- Stadion Strahov - Karlovo náměstí
- Lotyšská - Karlovo náměstí
and others

If you miss any important connection just let me know and I'll think about it.

Moreover, the app supports showing a notification updated with the latest info.
The notification can be shown manually in the app or using a tile
or automatically in the morning at a time set or with your alarm clock (auto-detected).

The connection data are fetched from https://pid.cz/o-systemu/opendata/. Thanks for being open.
